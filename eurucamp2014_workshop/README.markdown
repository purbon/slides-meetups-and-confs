# The Graph Atelier

Within this repository you will find a set of exercises that are planned as a one or two hours extension of an introductory graph processing workshop.

## Preconditions

This workshop is based on:

* Ruby as a programming language, specifically using JRuby as a VM.
* Neo4j as a graph database, specifically using the great neo4jrb.

but you can use any other tech stack to do this exercises.

To set this up you just have to clone this repository and then jump into the main directory, for experimentation you can create your own code, or  use the IRB console throw the command “rake console”.

## List of exercises

Nowadays you can find the next set of exercises here:

* The [Bacon number](tasks/the_kevin_bacon_number.markdown), where you’re required to find a method to compute this value.
* The [Berlin UBahn network](tasks/the_berlin_ubahn_network.markdown), where you can experiment with routing, or other kind of graph algorithms, using the Berliner UBahn network.

## FAQ

For questions, bugs, etc feel free to submit a pull request or just drop a message to me.
