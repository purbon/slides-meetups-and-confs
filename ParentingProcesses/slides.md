# Topics for today

* What it means to be in software engineering today?
* Numbers about parenting.
* What are common expectations from society?
* Startups and corporate company culture.
* What companies can and _should_ do.


# Software engineering today

* Software runs the world.
* No matter what, your job is usually your passion.
* Change is going to be a constant.
* Constant learning and improvement required.
* There is this idea that you should be programming at work and after work. There is life outside of a laptop, really!!!
* Craft or Engineering job, two different approaches for the same task.

##  Requirements

* Highly rewarding when problems are solved.
* Male centric business, women are scare (_also scared_).
* Ego centric arguments can be pretty important.

## Other facts

* Focus, being distracted regularly, _is bad_.
* Hero culture, long working hours.
* Irregular working hours, specially in Berlin startups... (10h ish)
* Lack of interest in STEM, _and this is for everyone_


# Numbers about parenting

* No rules applied, every child is different.
* Sleep might be valuable asset (specially in early days).
* Everyone likes the way they do it, and some are very vocal about it.
* Is an ongoing process for everyone, no time to complain for failure.

## When they start school

* Kindergarten is a petri dish, kids will get sick, you will get sick.
* Do you want to be involved with your child education.

## Time management

* Time gets scare resource? how do you manage it?
* Being an absent parent.
* Having your partner take all the load.
* Sharing.

## In a nutshell

* You are as bad parent as everyone else is! Keep this in mind.
* Empathy should never be forgotten, with kids and other parents.

## I wonder

* Is parenting a craft?
* Do you see many differences with day to day job in software?


# Society expectations 

* Care activity usually done by woman.
* This exclude them from work life long time.
* Parental benefits are different across countries.
* Encourages differences across woman and man in regards of child's.
* School schedules are not family friendly (specially in Spain).

## Leave of Absence

* Not taking _Mutterschutz_.
* Go quick back to work.
* Who goes to the doctors?.
* Who staying home when kids are ill? (_Kinderkrankengeld_).

## In a nutshell

* Who takes the most of the __burden__ involved with having kids?
* Women? Grand parents? shared?


# Companies

* Initial team, including founders set the culture for a company.
* Long working hours, no money, but we're cool!.
* Mission driven? are this companies going to safe the world? Over hipped environment.
* How do you understand productivity? Long hours? Getting things done?

## Perks

* Perks are usually club mate, beer, kicker, ping pong table, ...
* Food is provided, or subsided.
* [Long term education] Meetup's, usually run after hours.
* Some large companies might have day care benefits.

## Culture

* The hero effort culture, long working hours.
* Not used to remote working, or work from home culture, need to be in
  the office even if not necessary.
* Is empathy missing? should be there.

## Environment

* Hard working environment, could be frightening for some people.
* Companies hiring as if job was an extension of university. Ninja,
  hacker, ego driven in general.
* No hiring woman at certain ages, asking sometimes weird questions...


# Work life balance

* What does it means? How much work? / how much balance?
* Balance could mean different for one people than for others.
* Time for other things than Programming, kids and family get important?
* Basically means taking time for yourself, either for family, sports,
  relax, time to recharge from work duties.


# What can you do about it

* Understand who your employees are, singles, couples or people with kids have different needs or expectations, you can't deal with all the same way.
* Is challenging, but encouraging remote working, or work from home policies, really helps as time gets scare.
* If you hire grown up's you've to trust them to do the right thing.
* If your company has people all around the world try to have them similar kid benefits, each country is different. (ex: USA, Spain, Holland, Germany, Sweden).
* Don't exclude people with other interest or obligations from the company, meetings and decision making should be arrange at common time frames.
* If your startup/company have some parents, might be you will benefit from hiring a day care giver for them.
* If your employees are required to travel make sure they get time back for their own.

## Fear burnout

* Worst thing that can happen is a burn out employee.
* Happy employee usually means more productive one, including parents
  who value their time as is scare for them.
* When you loss employees, or have unhappy ones, this means your ability
  to grow is lower, your most valuable asset are your humans.
