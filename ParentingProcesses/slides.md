# Topics for today

* What it means to be in software engineering today?
* Numbers about parenting.
* What are common expectations from society?
* Startups and corporate company culture.
* What companies can, _should_ do.


# Software engineering today

* No matter what, your job is your passion.
* Change is going to be a constant.
* Constant learning and improvement required.
* Craft or Engineering job, two different approaches for the same task.

##  Soft requirements

* Software runs the world.
* Highly rewarding when problems are solved.
* Male centric business, women are scare (_also scared_).
* Ego centric arguments can be pretty important.
* Lack of interest in STEM, _and this is for everyone_

## Other facts

* Focus, being distracted regularly, _is bad_.
* Hero culture, long working hours.
* Irregular working hours, specially in berlin startups... (10h ish)


# Numbers about parenting

* No rules applied, every child is different.
* Sleep might be valuable asset (specially in early days).
* Everyone likes the way they do it, and some are very vocal about it.
* Is an ongoing process for everyone, no time to complain for failure.

## When they start school
* Kindergarten is a petri dish, kids will get sick, you will get sick.
* How do you involve with your child education.

## In a nutshell
* You are as bad parent as everyone else is! Keep this in mind.
* Empathy should never be forgotten, with kids and other parents.

## I wonder
* Is parenting a craft?
* Do you see many differences with day to day job in software?


# Expectations society sets

* Care activity usually done by woman.
* This exclude them from work life long time.
* Parental benefits are different across countries.
* Encourages differences across woman and man.
* School schedules are not family friendly (specially in Spain)

## How is absence taken and shared
* Not taking _Mutterschutz_.
* Go quick back to work.
* Who goes to the doctors?.
* Who staying home when kids are ill? (_Kinderkrankengeld_).

## In a nutshell

* Who takes the most of the __burden__ involved with having kids?
* Women? Grand parents? shared?


# Startup's and company culture.

## Perks
* Perks are usually club mate, beer, kicker, ping pong table, ...
* Food is provided, or subsided
* Meetup's, usually run after hours.

## Culture
* The hero effort culture, long working hours.
* Empathy to a common skill across companies.

## Environment
* Hard working environment, could be frightening for some people.
* Companies hiring as if job was an extension of university. Ninja,
  hacker, ego driven in general.
* No hiring woman at certain ages, asking sometimes weird questions...

# What is Work life balance?.....
